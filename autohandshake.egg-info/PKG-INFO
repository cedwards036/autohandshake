        Summary
        -------
        A library for automating tasks on the Handshake career services platform.
        
        Current functionality includes the automation of:
        
        * Getting data from Insights
        * Getting a complete record of your school's appointment type settings
        * Getting a complete record of your school's major mappings
        * Getting unfilled appointment slot data from the appointment calendar
        * Getting account access request data
        
        Typical usage looks like:
        ::
        
            from autohandshake import HandshakeSession, InsightsPage
        
            school_url = 'https://jhu.joinhandshake.com'
        
            with HandshakeSession(login_url=school_url, email=your_email) as browser:
                insights = InsightsPage(link_to_insights_report, browser)
                report_data = insights.get_data()
        
        
        **Important**: this package relies on an automated driver for Google Chrome, so users must have Chrome installed in order to use this package.
